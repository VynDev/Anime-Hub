**In development!**  
  
Keep your anime lists on your computer with this desktop software.

*Keep in mind this is currently a personnal project for learning purpose (C++/Qt), while I really want to finish it and do something nice, it might not be useful for everyone, see the goals of the project below*

## Goals of the project

- Having your anime lists on your computer, thus you can access it without a connection and doesn't depend on a third party service.
- Search animes online (through API like Anilist), that provide information (titles, cover image, synopsis, genres, etc.) about them.
- Manage multiple lists (watched, planned, etc... You can create the lists you want).
- Add animes to your lists directly from a search, thus you don't have to add the title, synopsis, image or whatever yourself (but you still can if you want it).
- Backup, it would be sad to lose your lists with 250 animes...

### Optional features

- Share your list with your friends with a simple P2P transfer, you'll have a copy of their list on your computer
- Cache image and useful data for offline use.
